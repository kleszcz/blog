# Hello World!

Oh, it was so obvious... But if every new programming language we learn by writing a hello world program, shouldn't blogging be the same?
Anyway, my name is Jan Kleszcyński and I am a game developer from Poland. I work at the company where I create gameplay for various games in C# both
in Unity and our in house tech. After hours I struggle to write something for my own, mostly in C++ and this blog would be about it.

For starters there would be a short article about UTF8 - UTF16 conversion later this day.

Enjoy!
